# ABC SNP calling pipeline

Scripts used to to help automate the ABC SNP calling pipeline

Tassel SNP calling was run for ApeKI and PstI/EcoT22I separately. To prep the keyfiles I ran "parse_keyfile.pl". 

For example:
    perl PATH_TO_SCRIPTS/parse_keyfile.pl 20160831_gbs_keyfile_usda_abc_cet.txt 20160831
